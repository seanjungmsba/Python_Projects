Contains the `ChessGame` class that manages gameplay between a stationary Bishop
and a Rook that moves based on random coin tosses and dice rolls.

 It handles:
    1 - piece placement
    2 - turn-by-turn simulation
    3 - move execution
    4 - capture detection 
    5 - logging
    6 - board visualization

        Piece management, round simulation, capture logic, logging, and board printing.

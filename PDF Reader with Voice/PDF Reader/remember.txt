Al is continuously evolving to benefit many different industries. Machines are wired using a
cross-disciplinary approach based in mathematics, computer science, linguistics,
psychology, and more.

Algorithms often play a very important part in the structure of artificial intelligence, where
simple algorithms are used in simple applications, while more complex ones help frame

strong artificial intelligence.

Applications of Artificial Intelligence

The applications for artificial intelligence are endless. The technology can be applied to many
different sectors and industries. Al is being tested and used in the healthcare industry for
dosing drugs and different treatment in patients, and for surgical procedures in the operating
room.

Other examples of machines with artificial intelligence include computers that play chess

and self-driving cars. Each of these machines must weigh the consequences of any action they
take, as each action will impact the end result. In chess, the end result is winning the game.
For self-driving cars, the computer system must account for all external data and compute it to
act in a way that prevents a collision.

Artificial intelligence also has applications in the financial industry, where it is used to detect
and flag activity in banking and finance such as unusual debit card usage and large account
deposits—all of which help a bank's fraud department. Applications for Al are also being used
to help streamline and make trading easier. This is done by making supply, demand, and
pricing of securities easier to estimate.

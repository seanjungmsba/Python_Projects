If you do import sys, you'll get to access the functions and variables in the module sys via sys.foo or sys.bar(). This can get a lot of typing, especially if using something from submodules (e.g. I often have to access django.contrib.auth.models.User). To avoid such this redundancy, you can bring one, many or all of the variables and functions into the global scope. from os.path import exists allows you to use the function exists() without having to prepend it with os.path. all the time.

If you'd like to import more than one variable or function from os.path, you could do from os.path import foo, bar.
